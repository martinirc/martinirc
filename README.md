👋 Hi, I’m @martinirc, but you can call me Moebiws.
👀 I’m interested in graphic design, high-end photography equipment, 3D rendering, and cutting-edge technology. I’m also deeply curious about the intersection of art and technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning Chinese and continuously improving my skills in visual arts, photography, and 3D design.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving digital advertising, visual arts, high-quality graphics, and immersive experiences such as VR and AR.

⚡ Fun fact:  I once tried to communicate with a stubborn octopus using interpretive dance and ended up with a new seafood recipe instead.
